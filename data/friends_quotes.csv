Joey: Maybe *you* need sex. I just had it a few days ago.

Rachel: No, Joey, U-N-I-sex.

Joey: I wouldn't say no to that.

"
2,NA,NA,"Chandler: I'm not so good with the advice... Can I interest you in a sarcastic comment?

"
3,NA,NA,"[Joey has packed an emergency kit with food, Mad-Libs and condoms]

Chandler: Condoms?

Joey: We don't know how long we're gonna be stuck here. We might have to repopulate the world.

Chandler: And condoms are the way to do that?

"
4,NA,NA,"[repeated line]

Joey Tribbiani: How you doin'?

"
5,NA,NA,"Joey: Rach, you gotta find out if he's in the same place you are. Otherwise, it's just a moo point.

Rachel: A moo point?

Joey: Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.

Rachel: Have I been living with him too long or did that all just make sense?

"
6,NA,NA,"[Monica knocks]

Chandler: You can't come in.

Monica: Why not?

Chandler: Because, uh, Ross is naked.

Ross: What?

Chandler: Well, I couldn't tell her *I* was naked. She's allowed to see me naked.

Ross: Why does *anyone* have to be naked?

"
7,NA,NA,"Phoebe: Look, I had a hard life. My mother was killed by a drug dealer.

Monica: Phoebe, your mom killed herself.

Phoebe: She was a drug dealer.

"

10,NA,NA,"[Ross is trying to talk Rachel's boss into giving her her job back so she won't go to Paris; Mr. Zelner has a son who is also named Ross]

Ross: Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?

Mr. Zelner: Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?

Ross: How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants.

[Mr. Zelner looks shocked]

Ross: I just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones - fossils!

"
11,NA,NA,"Ross: What are you doing tonight?

Chandler: Why, do you have a lecture?

Ross: No.

Chandler: Free as a bird, what's up?

"
12,NA,NA,"[repeated line]

Ross: We were on a break!

"
14,NA,NA,"Rachel: Can you take care of Emma just for today?

Ross: Sure, just lend me your breasts and we'll be on our way.

Chandler: Oh, my God.

Monica: Chandler, in all my life I never thought I would be so lucky as to fall in love with my best, my best...

[crying]

Monica: There's a reason why girls don't do this.

Chandler: Okay, okay I'll do it. I thought, wait I can do this, I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, that you make me happier than I ever thought I could be and if you let me I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?

Monica: Yes.

"
20,NA,NA,"Phoebe: [Right after playing a song in the coffee shop] If you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.

"
21,NA,NA,"Joey: I can't believe Ross is going out with Rachel's sister. Ya know, when Chandler made out with my sister, I was mad at him for, like, ten years.

Chandler: That was five years ago.

Joey: I know. You got five more years.

Chandler: Joey...

Joey: You want to make it six?

"
22,NA,NA,"Ross: First divorce: wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second divorce: said the wrong name at the altar, kind of my fault. Third divorce: they shouldn't let you get married when you're that drunk and have stuff drawn all over your face, Nevada's fault.

"
23,NA,NA,"Monica: I think I'd be great in a war. I'd, like, get all the medals.

Chandler: Before or after you're executed by your own troops?

"
24,NA,NA,"Joey: So, what, you just want to stay here and wait for Rachel to come back from her date?

Ross: Yeah. I mean, this guy could be my baby's stepfather.

Joey: They go out on one date and you worry about her marrying him? He's not you.

"
25,NA,NA,"[Joey just got ordained via the internet so that he could perform Monica and Chandler's wedding]

Joey: Hey, I started working on what I'm going to say at the ceremony. Wanna hear it?

Monica, Chandler: Yeah.

Joey: We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share.

[Monica and Chandler look impressed]

Joey: It is a love based of giving and receiving as well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving, we too can share and love and have... and receive.

[later]

Joey: Okay, you guys, I've got a little more written... are you ready?

Chandler: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

Joey: When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I cannot help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving... and then I can't think of a good word for right here.

Monica: How bout receiving?

Joey: Yes!

"
26,NA,NA,"[Joey is posing as a doctor in order to get information about a patient that Phoebe likes]

"
27,NA,NA,"Monica: Guys can fake it? Unbelievable! The one thing that's ours!

"
28,NA,NA,"Joey: Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get you?

30,NA,NA,"Monica: I'm Rachel. I love Ross. I hate Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross.

Rachel: I'm Monica. I can't get a boyfriend so I'll stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find there.

"
31,NA,NA,"Janice: [repeated line throughout the series] Oh... my... God!

"
32,NA,NA,"Rachel: I don't want my baby's first words to be ""How You Doing""

Chandler: ...And yet, I never run into Beyonce.

"
34,NA,NA,"[Chandler's roommate, Eddie has just accused him of sleeping with his ex girlfriend and killing his fish]

Phoebe: Why would you kill his fish?

Chandler: Because, Phoebe, sometimes after you sleep with someone you have to kill a fish.

"
35,NA,NA,"Phoebe: Ok, I got an idea. If it's a girl, Phoebe, naturally. And, if it's a boy... Phoebo.

Ross: Uhh... Sure, but let's not limit ourselves to just one name.

Rachel: Ok, I got one. If it's a girl... Sandrine. It's French.

Ross: That's a great name... for an industrial solvent.

Rachel: Ok, you got a better one?

Ross: Yeah, check this out. If it's a boy - Darwin.

Rachel: Yes, Ross, I do want a son who'll be regularly beaten in the schoolyard.

37,NA,NA,"Ross: [frantically presses buttons on answering machine] Oh my God! Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?

Rachel: [from behind] I got off the plane.

"
38,NA,NA,"[Rachel is upset about something]

Phoebe: Aww Pheebs.

Rachel: Honey, that's your name.

Phoebe: Oh, Pheebs is short for Phoebe I thought that's just what we called each other.

"
39,NA,NA,"Monica: Rach, it's the Visa card people.

Rachel: Oh, God, ask them what they want.

Monica: [on the phone] Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on.

[to Rachel]

Monica: Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.

Rachel: But I haven't used my card in weeks.

Monica: That is the unusual activity.

"
43,NA,NA,"[Re: ""If you had to give up sex or food, which would you pick?""]

Monica: Sex!

Chandler: Seriously. Answer faster.

Monica: I'm sorry, sweetie. When she said ""sex"" I wasn't thinking of sex with you.

Chandler: It's like a big hug.

Phoebe: Ross, how about you? Sex or food?

Ross: Sex!

Phoebe: What about sex or dinosaurs?

Ross: My God, it's like Sophie's Choice.

Phoebe: Joey, if you had to give up sex or food, which would you pick?

Joey: I don't know it's too hard.

Rachel: Come on, you have to answer.

Joey: Okay... sex. No, food. No, uh... I want both! I want girls on bread!

"
44,NA,NA,"Monica: [chasing after him] Chandler. It happens to lots of guys. You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it.

Chandler: [motioning with his hands] I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology. Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.

"
45,NA,NA,"Rachel: ...How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?

Dr Long: Three.

Ross: Just three? I'm dilated three!

"
46,NA,NA,"Phoebe: Chandler still thinks I'm pregnant and he hasn't asked me how I'm feeling or offered to carry my bags. I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him.

"
47,NA,NA,"Ross: I love marriage.

Phoebe: Seriously? You?... Divorce-O?

"
48,NA,NA,"Chandler: I can't say hump or screw in front of the b-a-b-y... I just spelled the wrong words didn't I?

"
49,NA,NA,"Joey: I'm Joey. I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.

"
50,NA,NA,"Joey: Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you. Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.

Chandler: You've got waaaay too much free time.

"
51,NA,NA,"[Monica tells the others that she and Chandler won't have any more sex before the wedding]

Ross: A no sex pact! I have one of those with every woman in America!

"
52,NA,NA,"Monica: Hey. Where's Joey?

Chandler: Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?

"
53,NA,NA,"Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?

Chandler: Oh, it's mine. I wrote a note to myself, and then I realized I didn't need, so I balled it up...

[notices Monica's angry glare]

Chandler: And now I wish I was dead.

"
54,NA,NA,"Joey: Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it'

[Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend fishhook]

Joey: Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.

[looks all confused]

Joey: And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.

"
55,NA,NA,"Chandler: Now, remember, Ben, keep your balance.

Ben: Thanks, daddy.

Ross: No, remember, Ben, two mommies, one daddy.

"
56,NA,NA,"Ross: Can I borrow your blue tie? Emma spit on mine.

Chandler: Okay, but you'll have to give it back when I get a job. Of course, by then, ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jumpsuits.

"
57,NA,NA,"[after settling a fight between Monica and Rachel]

Phoebe: Hey, if we were in prison, you guys would be like my bitches.

"
58,NA,NA,"Monica: Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?

Joey: I'd probably kill myself.

Monica: Excuse me?

Joey: Hey, if ""Little Joey""'s dead, then I got no reason to live.

Ross: Uh, Joey... Omnipotent.

Joey: You are? Ross, I'm sorry.

"
59,NA,NA,"[Ross and Joey's first meeting]

"
63,NA,NA,"Rachel: Wha... married?

Ross: Well, yeah, I think we should get married!

Rachel: What? Because that's your answer to everything?

"
64,NA,NA,"Chandler: And this from the cry-for-help department: Are you wearing makeup?

Joey: Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.

Chandler: That's funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.

"
65,NA,NA,"Ross: We were on a break!

Chandler: Oh, my God! If you say that one more time, I'm going to break up with you!

"
66,NA,NA,"[Joey has to sleep with a woman to get a part]

Joey: I just don't think that I want it that way though, you know? I mean, let's say I do make it, all right? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of... y'know, the Little General.

Chandler: Didn't you use to call it the Little Major?

Joey: Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.

"
67,NA,NA,"Ross: Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-alike contest and *won*!

Chandler: Ross came fourth and cried!

"
68,NA,NA,"Chandler: I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of out secrets.

Joey: What secrets?

Chandler: Oh no-no, Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.

[the girls walk away]

Joey: You'll tell me later?

Chandler: You already know.

Gunther: I thought you were Chandler.

[Joey looks disturbed]

Gunther: [motioning to Chandler] Um, one of you is over there.

"
71,NA,NA,"Monica: You don't like the game, because you suck at it.

Chandler: I don't suck at it. It sucks. And you suck.

"
72,NA,NA,"Monica: Anyway, are you gonna get a handyman to install all this stuff?

Rachel: No, I was going to do this all by myself.

Joey: [laughs] You're gonna do it?

Rachel: Yeah. Why, you don't think a woman can do this?

Joey: Oh, women can. You... can't.

"
73,NA,NA,"[Upon hearing Ross practicing the bagpipe for their wedding]

Monica: Why must your family be Scottish?

Chandler: Why must your family be *Ross*?

"
74,NA,NA,"[a ritual to get rid of bad-boyfriend karma]

Phoebe: Okay, now we need the sage branches and the sacramental wine.

Monica: All I have is oregano and a Fresca.

Phoebe: That's okay.

[Adds them]

Phoebe: All right, now we need the semen of a righteous man.

Rachel: OK, Pheebs, you know what? If we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.

"
75,NA,NA,"Monica: Joey, did you actually interview her before you asked her to move in?

Joey: Of course I did.

Monica: Well, what did you ask her?

Joey: 'When can you move in?'.

"
76,NA,NA,"Ross: Ok, look. You don't have to get married. We can just go home and take a shower. That's not so scary is it?

Chandler: Depends on what you mean by ""we"".

"
77,NA,NA,"Joey: You think I need a new walk?

Chandler: What?

Joey: Well I've had the same walk since high school and you know how when a guy walks into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.

Chandler: Are you actually saying these words?

"
78,NA,NA,"Ross: [after trying to kiss his cousin]

[thinking]

Ross: Say something. Say anything. Nothing you say could make this situation worse. Oh my God, this is the longest that anyone has not spoken EVER.

[actually speaking to his cousin]

Ross: I haven't had sex in a very long time.

[thinking again]

Ross: Yeah you really shouldn't have said anything.

"
79,NA,NA,"Joey: [drinking a beer on the boat] Look at this clown. Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.

[yelling]

Joey: Get out of the way jackass.

[to Rachel]

Joey: Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?

Rachel: That is the Coast Guard.

"
80,NA,NA,"[Ross is trying to cheer Chandler up who won't get out of his sweatpants]

Ross: C'mon man, just take 'em off, just take 'em off and we'll have some fun.

"
81,NA,NA,"Mike Hanigan: You're not gonna try and make me join a cult are you?

Ross: No...

Mike Hanigan: Oh okay. You just have that look.

Ross: [to himself] Damn SuperCuts!

"
83,NA,NA,"Nora Bing: Hi, Chandler. This is Dennis. He's a great guy...

Nora Bing: [softly] ... and a fantastic lover.

Chandler: Hello, Dennis. Thank you for pleasing my mother so.

"
84,NA,NA,"Monica: Are you sure you peed on the stick right?

Rachel: How many ways are there to do that?

"
85,NA,NA,"Chandler: My dad slept with Mr. Gribaldi.

Monica: Who's Mr. Gribaldi?

Chandler: DOES IT MATTER?

"
86,NA,NA,"Monica: Hi.

Chandler: You are not gonna believe what I did today.

Monica: Well, clearly you didn't shower or shave.

Chandler: I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule. They should change the name to Ms. Chandler.

[pause]

Chandler: Although, I hope they don't.

Monica: Wait a minute, you staid home all day playing Ms. Pacman, while I was at work like some kind of chump?

Chandler: Yeah, and I got all the top ten scores and erased Phoebe off the board. High five!

Monica: What is the matter with your hand?

Chandler: Well, I've been playing for like eight hours. It'll loosen up, come on check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, their dirty words.

Monica: Chandler, why would you do that?

Chandler: Because it's awesome.

Monica: You think this is clever?

Chandler: Well, they only give you three letters, so after A.S.S., it is a bit of a challenge.

Monica: Wait a minute, this one's not dirty.

Chandler: Well, it is, when you put it together with that one.

Monica: Oh, well, if you don't clear this off, you wont be getting those from me. Ben's coming tomorrow over to play this game, this can't be there.

Chandler: Come on, he wont even know what they mean.

Monica: He's seven, not stupid.

Chandler: Have you talked to him lately?

Monica: All right, I'm just going to unplug it...

Chandler: No, no, no, if you'll unplug it, then there will be nothing to show from my day. It would be like I was at work!

[Monica unplugs it]

Chandler: Look at that, look at that, it's still there, this thing must have a primitive ROM chip!

Monica: You gotta beat your scores.

Chandler: With the claw?

Monica: Fine, I'll do it. We gotta get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him ""Pull my finger"".

Chandler: Pull my finger... my hand is messed up!

"
87,NA,NA,"Ross: I guess I should have known... we'd be out somewhere, and a beautiful woman would go by, and Carol would go, ""Ross, look at her."" And I'd think, ""My wife is cool.""

"
88,NA,NA,"Ross: Oh, really? Well, I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.

Chandler: Du-ude!

Monica: What happened in Atlantic City?

Ross: Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...

Chandler: Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude""?

Ross: ...and this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after a while he just goes over to her and, uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking. Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls. And you're right. Chandler's not the type of guy just goes to bars and makes out with girls.

Monica: You kissed a guy? Oh my God.

Chandler: In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.

"
89,NA,NA,"[in Barbados, Rachel runs into Monica and Chandler's room in the morning and opens the curtains, it has been raining a lot]

Monica: No. No. I shouldn't have even opened these. I mean I - Joey, I am out of control. Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present. Okay?

Joey: Okay.

Monica: Give me one more.

Joey: Okay.

[hands her one]

"
92,NA,NA,"Joey: I am telling this to Rachel.

Monica: No, Joey.

Joey: Unless...

Chandler: Unless what?

Joey: Unless you name your first born after me.

Chandler: What? Why?

Joey: Oh ho ho. You almost had me there.

"

Chandler: There's this guy at her work that she says is the funniest guy she ever met.

Joey: How could she do that? She know being funny is your thing.

Chandler: I know. So could you mention fire trucks when she comes in.

Joey: I don't know. I'm not too good at memorizing lines.

Chandler: [sarcastically] It's a good thing you don't have to do that for a living.

Joey: I know.

"
102,NA,NA,"Ross: [leaning over and talking to Rachel's lap] I can't wait to play with you all day, and to hear your first words.

Phoebe: [wide eyed] Why are you letting him talk to your crotch that way?

Rachel: He's talking to the baby.

Phoebe: Oh, that's good. Because when I heard, ""I can't wait to hear your first words"" I thought, ""Boy that's some trick!""

"
103,NA,NA,"Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.

Joey: Yeah, right!... Y'serious?

Phoebe: Oh, yeah!

Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.

Monica: Absolutely.

Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.

Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.

Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.

"
104,NA,NA,"Ross: If you're going to call me names, I would prefer Ross, the Divorce Force. It's just cooler.

"
105,NA,NA,"Ross: Oh. *Oh*. Thank God, most women don't even feel them.

Rachel: Okay, no uterus, no opinion.

"
106,NA,NA,"Ross: You know, we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that's half human, half *pure evil*!

"
107,NA,NA,"[Rachel complaining about her father]

Rachel: Oh, it was horrible. He called me ""young lady"".

Chandler: Ugh, I hate when my father calls me that.

"
108,NA,NA,"Phoebe: No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.

Chandler: Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.

"
109,NA,NA,"Joey: Va fa napoli.

"
110,NA,NA,"Phoebe: Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap, asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap. He said all you need is to write them a song. Now you haven't heard it yet, so don't try to sing along. No don't sing along. Monica, Monica, have a happy Hannukah. I saw Santa Claus, he said hello to Ross. And please tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy. And Rachel and Chandler... have a

[mumble]

Phoebe: handlerrrrr.

"
111,NA,NA,"Chandler: What? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?

Ross: A little louder, okay? I think there's a man on the twelfth floor - in a COMA - who didn't hear you.

"
112,NA,NA,"[a beautiful women is checking out Chandler]

Phoebe: [stands up] Ok, I need to get this right so give me a sec...

[clears throat and talks in a deep voice]

113,NA,NA,"Rachel: How about for a girl, Rain?

Ross: Rain? ""Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln and my dress is made out of wheat.""

"
114,NA,NA,"Chandler: [after accidentally spitting out gum whilst trying to blow a bubble to ""charm"" Jill Goodacre]

[thinks]

Chandler: Just reach over and pick it up...

[discreetly picks up gum from table and pops it back in mouth]

Chandler: There we go! Good save! Now it's all good and you're... chewing someone else's gum. Oh, my God! Oh, my *God*!

[suddenly starts to gag]

Chandler: And now you're choking.

Jill Goodacre: [frowns] Are you okay?

[Chandler continues to choke and flashes a thumbs-up]

"

Chandler: Too many jokes. Must mock Joey.

"
116,NA,NA,"Monica: Okay. Wait-wait-wait. Shhh.

[Bangs on her glass with a spoon to make a toast]

Monica: Okay, umm, I just wanna say that... I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night.

[Chandler clears his throat]

Monica: Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit.

"
117,NA,NA,"[Chandler fell asleep, during Joey's movie. The credits roll, and Chandler wakes up]

Chandler: Great show. Good work, Joey.

Joey: You liked it?

Chandler: Liked it? I loved it.

Joey: What did you like best about it?

Chandler: I liked... everything the whole show.

Joey: What about the specifics?

Chandler: Specifics? Specifics were the best part.

Joey: What about the scene with the kangaroo?

Chandler: I... I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.

Joey: You fell asleep. There was no kangaroo. They didn't take any of my suggestions.

"
118,NA,NA,"Joey: [thinking] OK, I have no feelings for Rachel. No feelings at all. She's just a friend. I mean, I might have had some feelings for her, but now they're all gone. All of them. As a matter of fact, I don't think I ever had feelings for Rachel.

[Rachel walks into the room]

Rachel: Hey, sweetie.

Joey: [thinking] I love you.

"
119,NA,NA,"[Chandler and Joey got two lawn chairs, a chick and a duck]

Chandler: Could we BE more white trash?

"
120,NA,NA,"[Rachel doesn't take his advice]

Joey: Fine. No one ever listens to me. If the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.

"
121,NA,NA,"Rachel: I'm not someone who goes after a guy five minutes after he's divorced.

Monica: No, you go after them five minutes before they get married...

"
122,NA,NA,"[Mona doesn't know that Rachel is living with Ross]

Mona: Listen, Rachel, I appreciate your situation but this is Valentine's Day. So, if you don't mind, would you please just go back home?

[Ross enters with his gift for Mona]

Rachel: What are you talking about? I live here.

Ross: [nervously gives Mona her present] Happy Valentine's Day.

[Mona stares angrily at Ross]

Ross: Or, something to remember me by...

"
123,NA,NA,"Joey: Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man. Just stop calling.

"
124,NA,NA,"Ross: This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.

Chandler: What, you never look down in the shower?

[pause]

Chandler: Oh, please. I'm not allowed to make *one* joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?

"
125,NA,NA,"Joey Tribbiani: [after smelling potpourri] Well, this is like summer in a bowl!

"
126,NA,NA,"Phoebe: [Rachel's hormones are raging] She's going through her fourth month of pregnancy. Remember when I was in my fourth month?

Monica: Yes, that was the Evander Holyfield period. You know, you were so hard up, you even came on to me.

Phoebe: Did not!

Monica: Yes, you did.

[puts on a seductive look]

Monica: Listen, Phoebe, I could have had you if I had wanted you.

Phoebe: Oh, yeah? Well, bring it on.

[blows Monica a kiss]

Rachel: Guys! Stop it! This is even turning me on!

"
127,NA,NA,"Joey: I don't get it. Why can't we use the same toothbrush? We use the same soap.

Chandler: That's different. The toothbrush has been in my mouth.

Joey: OK. But next time you're in the shower, think of the first place you're washing, and the last place I washed.

"
128,NA,NA,"Chandler: The only way I would've said six would have been if I had said, ""Let's meet at seven, not at six.""

Monica: The only way I would've said seven, would have been if I had said, 'Wow, my boyfriend is such a wiseass... Seven!'

"
129,NA,NA,"[Ross is walking down the aisle at Chandler and Monica's wedding]

Ross: Wow. This is the first time I've walked down the aisle without the possibility of it ending in divorce.

"
130,NA,NA,"Rachel: Oh, honey. Don't get up. What do you need?

Phoebe: Oh, no. Oh, nothing.

Rachel: Come on. I am here to take care of you. What do you need? Anything.

Phoebe: Okay, I have a wedgie.

Rachel: Okay, that is all you.

"
131,NA,NA,"Chandler: You know, I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.

Monica: Me too.

Chandler: You know, I was, uh, thinking. If you and I had a big fight and broke up for a few hours...

Monica: Yeah?

Chandler: Technically we could have sex again. So, what do you think... bossy and domineering?

Monica: The wedding's off, sloppy and immature.

[they get up]

Monica: Oh, wait. We can't, my cousin Cassie is in the guest room.

Chandler: Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.

Monica: Shrill? The wedding's back on.

"
132,NA,NA,"Chandler: All right. You guys don't have to stop having fun just 'cause I'm here. You don't have to feel bad, either. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you...

[to Joey]

Chandler: Well, except you.

"
133,NA,NA,"Joey: Heh. Let me get this straight. He got you to *beg* to sleep with him. He got you to say he *never* has to call you again. And he got you thinking this is a *great* idea?

Phoebe: [weakly] Uh-huh.

Joey: This man is my God!

"
134,NA,NA,"Rachel: Hey Ben, you know what? When you were a baby, you and I used to do all sorts of stuff together, coz I was your daddy's girlfriend.

Ben: But you're not anymore.

Rachel: No, no we're not.

Ben: Coz you and dad were on a break.

"
135,NA,NA,"Rachel: Hey, just so you know: it's *not* that common, it *doesn't* ""happen to every guy, "" and it *is* a big deal!

Chandler: [pointing] I *knew* it!

"
136,NA,NA,"[Joey and Chandler apartment has been robbed]

Joey: Aw, man. He took the five of spades.

[looks through deck]

Joey: No, here it is.

"
137,NA,NA,"Joey: Pheebs, you wanna help?

Phoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.

"
138,NA,NA,"Gunther: Hey buddy, this is a family place. Put the mouse back in the house.

"
139,NA,NA,"Phoebe: Well, I'm a pacifist. But, when the revolution comes, I'll destroy all of you.

[pause]

Phoebe: Except for you, Joey.

"
140,NA,NA,"Rachel: You didn't finish reading it?

Ross: It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for eighteen pages - front and back!

"
141,NA,NA,"[Chandler enters with a terrible hang-over]

Monica: How ya doin'?

Chandler: Well, my apartment's not there anymore because I drank it.

"
142,NA,NA,"Chandler: All right, look if you absolutely have to tell her the truth, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.

"
143,NA,NA,"Susie: How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?

Chandler: Because I went to an all-boys high school and God is making up for it.

"
144,NA,NA,"Phoebe: Today is Mike and my one year anniversary.

Rachel: Oh! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date? Your first kiss? The first time you had sex?

Phoebe: Yeah!

"
145,NA,NA,"Ross: I would date her but there is a big age difference.

Joey: Well think about it when you're 90...

Ross: I know, she'll be 80 and it won't be such a big difference.

Joey: No. What I was gonna say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.

"
146,NA,NA,"[to Ross]

Chandler: You know if your not careful, you could not get married at all this year.

"
147,NA,NA,"Ross: [holding a bottle of champagne] Gunther, six glasses!

Gunther: [hopeful] Six? You want me to join you?

Ross: Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five will be fine.

[Gunther walks away disappointed]

Ross: Boy I'm gonna get spit in my coffee, now.

"
148,NA,NA,"Rachel: [walking out of the bathroom] Mon, I'm gonna to check my messages.

Chandler: And you thought of that in there?

Monica: Well, nature called and she wanted to see who else did.

"
149,NA,NA,"Ross: Hey, Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart? Pheebs?

Phoebe: Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?

Ross: Hey, I might.

"
150,NA,NA,"Phoebe: I remember the day I got my first paycheck. There was a cave-in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.

Monica: Wow, you - you worked in a mine?

Phoebe: No, I worked in a Dairy Queen. Why?

"
151,NA,NA,"Rachel: Ok, Joey, we'll do it one more time. Don't forget the rules -heads I win, tails you lose.

Joey: Just flip the coin!

"
152,NA,NA,"Rachel: [upset] All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.

Ross: Seriously?

Rachel: Yes, I was 4 years-old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to - had to cut a big chunk of my hair.

[she starts crying]

Rachel: And it was uneven for weeks.

Ross: [sarcastically] And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie.

Rachel: Ok, fine. You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there.

[pause]

Rachel: And I was thinking Claire Danes.

"
153,NA,NA,"Joey: [during Ross's speech, Joey laughs every time he hears 'homo erectus'] Ha, Ha, he said 'erectus'.

[notices Rachel is also laughing]

Joey: Erectus?

Rachel: [stifling laugh] No, 'homo'.

"
154,NA,NA,"Monica: Okay, I've got a leg, three breasts, and a wing.

Chandler: How do you find clothes that fit?

"
155,NA,NA,"Monica: This has been like my dream ever since I got my first Easy-Bake Oven and opened ""Easy Monica's Bakery"".

"
156,NA,NA,"[talking about Ralph Lauren]

Joey: I hate his underwear. one time I brought a pair marked XS and let me tell you there's no room for anything excess in there.

"
157,NA,NA,"Monica: Pack your things, we're going to Vegas.

Chandler: You mean, we're just gonna elope? This is great. We're gonna save so much money. And, no more pain-in-the-ass planning.

[Monicas stares at him]

Chandler: Oh, we're not going to elope. We have so much money, could our wedding please be bigger?

"
158,NA,NA,"[after Joey told Rachel he loved her, she told him her boss wanted to buy her baby in order to make things less awkward]

Rachel: Joey, I'm really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things...

Joey: I know. I know.

Rachel: It kinda worked. I mean you know, I don't know about you but I haven't thought about our thing since all this.

Joey: Hey you're right. Yeah, it's kinda been like us again a little bit.

Rachel: Yeah I know. I miss that.

Joey: Me too. I mean I... haven't thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn't feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.

[long, awkward pause]

Rachel: My gynecologist tried to kill me.

"
159,NA,NA,"[Looking through the ads in a newspaper]

Monica: There are no jobs for me.

Joey: Wait, here's one. Um, would you be willing to cook naked?

Monica: There's an ad for a naked chef?

Joey: No. But if you'd be willing to COOK naked, you might be willing to DANCE naked.

"
160,NA,NA,"Joey: Dude, stop talkin' crazy and make us some tea!

"
161,NA,NA,"Chandler: [Monica thinks their maid stole her pants and bra] Monica, come on do you really think that she would steal from us, then come back and wear it right in front of you?

Monica: Don't you see? It's the PERFECT crime!

Chandler: [acting as outraged as her] She must have been planning this for years!

"
162,NA,NA,"Joey Tribbiani: You don't put words in people's mouths, you put *turkey* in people's mouths!

"
168,NA,NA,"Rachel: I've never asked a guy out before.

Phoebe: You've never asked a guy out?

Rachel: No. Have you?

Phoebe: Thousands of times. That doesn't make me sound too good, does it?

"
169,NA,NA,"Chandler: Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.

Ross: Ah, the lesser known ""I Don't Have a Dream"" speech.

"
170,NA,NA,"[Chandler and Joey emerge from the bathroom after hiding from a fight between Ross and Monica]

Chandler: That was pretty intense, huh?

Joey: Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here.

And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tyre yard by an escaped mental patient who in his own words wanted to ""kill me, or whatever."" So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.

"
175,NA,NA,"Monica: I'll never have a first kiss again.

Phoebe: You'll have a last kiss.

"

Joey: Yeah.

Kate Miller: I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of a reason than that.

Joey: Oh, hey, how about this one? It says so in the script! Y'know, I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean, it says in the script here that you're a bitch.

Joey: Really?

Chandler: No, freak show! She's fictional!

"

Chandler: I'm not macho.

Monica: You're right. I don't know what I was thinking.

"
217,NA,NA,"Ross: My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.

Monica: Wow. That's great. Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.

Ross: Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.

Chandler: Well, did-did you correct him?

Ross: No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.

"
218,NA,NA,"Eddie: [Chandler just asked him to move out] This is kinda out of the blue, isn't it?

Chandler: No, no, no. This isn't out of the blue. This is smack dab in the middle of the blue.

"
219,NA,NA,"Joey: What? You made a bet. A bet is a bet. You bet on a bet, and if you lose you lose the bet.

"
220,NA,NA,"Chandler: Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it. I don't think that was my point.

"
221,NA,NA,"[Chandler's trying to quit smoking]

Chandler: Eww, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock in my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.

Ross: Okay, I think it's time to change someone's nicotine patch.

[does so]

Chandler: [deadpan] Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.

"
222,NA,NA,"Chandler: I got a job in advertising. Well, not a paying job. More of an internship. But, they hire people they like.

Phoebe: Oh, right, like they're going to let me have a passport?

"
224,NA,NA,"Chandler: [taking duck out in the hallway] Now you stay out here and you think about what you did.

Ross: That's a duck.

Chandler: That's a bad duck.

Joey: They go into the chipper.

Phoebe: Why do I get the feeling that's not as happy as it sounds?

"
230,NA,NA,"Monica: I can't believe my dad saw us having sex. He didn't make it to one of my piano recitals, but this he sees.

"
231,NA,NA,"[Ross's hand is in a cast and he is struggling to write something down]

Joey: Hey, do you need any help?

Ross: Why, does it look like I'm having trouble with my mis-shapened claw?

Jack Geller: Bye.

"

[as she puts it in her purse]

Phoebe: ... that he gave to Phoebe.

"
235,NA,NA,"[Ross is about to tell Rachel that he loves her before she leaves for Paris, but Gunther walks up to her first]

Rachel: Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a cafÃ©, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.

Susan: Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise they don't let you do it.

"
238,NA,NA,"Joey: [to Ross] Forget about Rachel. Go to China, eat Chinese food.

Chandler: Of course there they'd just call it food.

"
239,NA,NA,"Rachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.

Joey: [pause] ... Are we still talking about sex?

"
240,NA,NA,"Joey Tribbiani: [upon hearing Ross doesn't want to go to the movies with him] Come on, man! Tom Hanks! Meg Ryan! They get mail!

Monica: You flitted off to Vail as soon as you met Barry.

Rachel: For once, could you not just remember every little thing?

"
242,NA,NA,"Ross: So, uh, what did the insurance company say?

Chandler: Well, I don't know what Big Leon told you but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night.

"

Jill Green: No. What?

Rachel: Well... she died.

"
245,NA,NA,"Joey: It's just my character that's not brain-dead.

"

Phoebe: Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.

Rachel: Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.

"
248,NA,NA,"Monica: [about the erogenous zones] Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.

Chandler: That-that's bad?

Rachel: Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.

Chandler: Well you might if it were anything like 7.

"
249,NA,NA,"Phoebe: I think the most romantic song is the one that Elton John wrote for that guy from ""who's the Boss?""

Monica: Which one was that?

Phoebe: You know, uh, ""Hold me closer, Tony Danza... "".

"
250,NA,NA,"Jill Green: All right, I'm leaving. Because I'm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That's you Rachel.

Chandler: Yeah you gotta love the talking.

Monica: And the sex?

Chandler: Alright we hadn't have sex yet. Okay. What's the big deal?This is special. I want our love to grow before moving to the next level.

Rachel: Oh, chandler, that is so nice.

Ross: That is really nice... Lying! No way is that the reason.

Rachel: Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?

Chandler: He's right. I'm totally lying.

Monica: Then what is it?

Chandler: Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.

Ross: And you're afraid you won't be able to fill his shoes?

Chandler: No. I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.

Ross: I was going for the metaphor.

Chandler: Yes and I was saying the actual words.

Monica: Big deal. So Joey has had a lot of girlfriends. That doesn't mean he's great in bed.

Chandler: We share a wall. So either is great in bed, or she just liked to agree with him a lot.

Monica: With you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great because you guys are in love.

Chandler: Yeah?

Ross: Just go for it Chandler.

Monica, Rachel: Yeah you should.

Chandler: All right. All right. I'll sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.

Chandler: How do you not fall down more often?

"
282,NA,NA,"Chandler: Where is Ross at? Hasn't he checked out yet?

Monica: Are you kidding me? It's not 11:00 yet that means Ross still has 11 mins to check out of the hotel, and Ross has NEVER checked out of a hotel early.

Rachel: Oh yeah that's right. One time Ross and I were at a hotel and we got a late check out... Ross was so happy it was the best sex we ever had!

337,NA,NA,"[Rachel, Phoebe and Joey have just found out that Chandler, Ross and Monica went to an after party with Hootie and the Blowfish]

Phoebe: What's on your neck?

Monica: That? That would be the work of a Blowfish.

"
338,NA,NA,"Ross: What the hell are you doing, you scared the crap out of me!

"
339,NA,NA,"Phoebe: Oh, my God! The foster puppets!

"
340,NA,NA,"Julie: [Monica has told everyone about Chandler's third nipple] You know, Chandler, in some cultures a third nipple is considered a mark of virility. The most desirable women dance naked around you so you can make your pick.

Chandler: Ah, would any of these cultures be in the tri-state area?

Julie: Sorry.

"
341,NA,NA,"Monica: Whoa. Where you going in those pants? 1982?

"
342,NA,NA,"Monica: That's probably because their nerves are deadened from being so stupid.

"
343,NA,NA,"Rachel: Come on. You guys can pee standing up.

"
344,NA,NA,"Phoebe: You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.

Chandler: Maureen Rosilla.

Ross: ""'Cause she doesn't hate Yanni"" is not a real reason.

"
345,NA,NA,"[talking to Monica]

Chandler: Yeah, I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.

"
346,NA,NA,"Chandler: You took your eggs and you left. Do you really expect me never to find new eggs?

"
347,NA,NA,"Rachel: I've never been to an analyst!

Phoebe: And it shows.

"
348,NA,NA,"Chandler: Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.

Monica: He's in the bathroom... I don't think you wanna go in there!

Chandler: C'mon, we're roommates... Aaaaaaaagh! My eyes! My eyes!

"
349,NA,NA,"Chandler: I know they call this a love seat but I'm not feeling anything special towards you...

Ross: [takes newspaper... folds it up... faces Chandler... and hits him...]

"
350,NA,NA,"Chandler: Am I sexy in Tulsa?

"
351,NA,NA,"Monica: Damn the jellyfish! Damn ALL the jellyfish!

"
352,NA,NA,"Chandler: I am holding up these cushions as a symbol of my remorse! Though you may haveth anger now...

"
353,NA,NA,"Ross: That sandwich was the one good thing in my life. Someone ate the one good thing in my life.

"
354,NA,NA,"Phoebe: It's raining. I don't like to fly in the rain.

Joey: Oh, I'm going to go for a walk in the rain.

Rachel: Oh... me too!

Phoebe: Huh! I bet they're doing it!

"
355,NA,NA,"Phoebe: It's because of stuff like this that you're BURNING IN HELL!

"
356,NA,NA,"Chandler: Well actually, gum would be perfection.

[voice over]

Chandler: Gum would be perfection? Where did that come from? Coulda said thanks, coulda said I'll have a stick but no, for me, gum would be perfection. I loathe myself.

"
357,NA,NA,"[Monica and Chandler are having sex in the other room]

Joey: You can't have s-e-x in front of a b-a-b-i-e

"
358,NA,NA,"Phoebe: And then what happened?

The Duck: [flaps its wings]

Phoebe: Ooooh!

[Joey comes in]

Phoebe: Hi Joey!

[she puts the duck on the floor]

Phoebe: This isn't over!

"
359,NA,NA,"Jack Geller: Of course you could kick Chandler's ass, son.

Judy Geller: You could kick any ass you wanted to!

"
360,NA,NA,"Shrink Boyfriend: Come on, tell me about it.

Phoebe: [Lies down] Well, it's my friends. They have a liking problem. With you. In that... they don't.

Shrink Boyfriend: Oh.

Phoebe: But I do! Me, Phoebe.

Shrink Boyfriend: Well, I can't say I'm surprised. It's what I've come to expect from this kind of co-dependent, dysfunctional group dynamic, this sitting around in your Coffee House drinking from Cups which, I'm sorry, may as well have nipples on them! Saying ""Oh, define me, define me! Love me, I need love!""

[they break up]

"
361,NA,NA,"Ross: [Very drunk in Vegas] It's Joey, I love Joey!

Rachel: Joey lives with a duck!

"
362,NA,NA,"Rachel: [after winning a hand of poker. sing-song to Ross] I have got your money, and you'll never see it, and your fly's still open

[pause]

Rachel: ha, I made you look.

"
363,NA,NA,"Ross: I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.

Joey, Chandler: That's nice.

Ross: No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby. I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defense is comin' right at me.

Joey: Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.

Ross: Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, I just heave it downfield.

Chandler: What are you crazy? That's a baby!

Joey: He should take the sack?

Ross: Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield, and I realize that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See, I am so not ready to be a father.

Chandler: Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.

Joey: Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.

"
364,NA,NA,"Carol: Oh, what do you know? No-one's going up to you and saying, ""Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this

[shouts]

Carol: pot roast through it?""

"
365,NA,NA,"Chandler: Ok, I'm just going to go outside.

Ross: Whoa, whoa, hold it.

Chandler: Don't worry. I'm not going to run away again. I just want to get some fresh air.

Ross: Ok.

Chandler: [exits into hallway and lights a cigarette] Ahh, fresh air...

"
366,NA,NA,"Joey: Of course it was a line!

Monica: Why? Why? Why would anyone do something like that?

Ross: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than, ""to get you into bed.""

"
367,NA,NA,"Ross: Hey who is this Casey? Why's he calling Rachel?

Chandler: Well I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance... You know make a little love... Well pretty much get down tonight...

Ross: [puts message in cupboard]

"
368,NA,NA,"Rachel: [Referring to Ross's new girlfriend] Ooh look, she's touching his leg.

Phoebe: Oh you see, that's probably nothing she's very sexually aggressive.

"
369,NA,NA,"Ross: You guys won't believe what I have to do for work today!

Chandler: Yes, but Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.

"
370,NA,NA,"Ross: I'm FINE!

"
371,NA,NA,"[Chandler is caught smoking]

Phoebe: Oh, I can't believe you. You've been so good, for three years.

Chandler: And this- is my reward.

Ross: Hold on a second, all right? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.

Chandler: Okay, so this time I won't quit.

"
372,NA,NA,"Monica: Look, Chandler, I feel really bad about this. Please have this bachelor party.

Chandler: No.

Monica: Stop being a baby and watch the hot woman get naked.

Chandler: ...All right.

Joey: YEAH.

Chandler: But, I'm only doing this for you... And Joey.

Monica: Ok, so who's going to be there?

Chandler: No, no, no. Just Ross and Joey is humiliating enough.

Ross: Well, actually, I have a date tonight.

Chandler: Yeah, I understand. What kind of guy would blow off a date for a fake bachelor party.

Joey: [on cell phone] Yeah, baby, I'm not gonna make it tonight...

"
373,NA,NA,"Phoebe: [Imitating someone really annoying] ""Oh, I slept with Billy Joel."" Who hasn't?

"
374,NA,NA,"Phoebe: Hey. Why isn't it Spidermen? You know, like Goldmen, Silvermen.

Chandler: Because, it... it's not his last name.

Phoebe: It isn't?

Chandler: No. It's not like Phil Spidermen. He's a spider *man*. You know, like Goldmen is a last name but there's no gold man.

Phoebe: Oh, oh okay...

Phoebe: There should *be* a gold man!

"
375,NA,NA,"Ross: Okay, there you go.

Rachel: Sure. Sure, I'll just sit next to the... transsexual from purchasing.

"
376,NA,NA,"Rachel: Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.

Mark: Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!

Rachel: Sorry.

Mark: Okay. I'll just go home and get back at him by myself.

"
377,NA,NA,"[Trying to fix up Monica with a date]

Joey: Aw, c'mon, this guy's perfect for you.

Monica: No, not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.

"
378,NA,NA,"Joey: Get your sorry, non-believer ass out of my chair.

"
379,NA,NA,"Rachel: [Phoebe's ""sold out"" at a corporate massage parlour] Of course I admire you Phoebe! You have principles! I don't have any.

"
380,NA,NA,"Rachel: You always have to be right.

Ross: I do not always- I'm not doing this.

Rachel: Jurassic Park could happen.

Ross: [gives up]

"
381,NA,NA,"Chandler: [conflicted over Kathy] That's no good, I'm starting to yearn!

"
382,NA,NA,"Phoebe: Please don't kill yourself. My mother did, I know what I'm talking about. And besides, I wasn't even meant to be working today. Don't you see that the Universe wants you to live?

Suicidal Guy who doesn't need Toner: [shouts at his coworkers] Do you hear that? I don't need you people. The Universe cares about me! The whole Universe! Ha-ha-ha!

[They ignore him. To Phoebe]

Suicidal Guy who doesn't need Toner: I wish they cared a little bit...

"
383,NA,NA,"Rachel: Yes, Phoebe, but Jack gave up a Cow, and I gave up an Orthodontist!

Phoebe: Did you love him?

Rachel: No.

Phoebe: Well, there you go, Jack loved the Cow.

"
384,NA,NA,"Joey: [can't find the Hot Girl] Hot Girl? Hot Girl!

"
385,NA,NA,"Resident's Commitee Member: [pinning up warning notice] Watch out for this guy. They say he's looking for some kind of Hot Girl.

Ross: Who isn't?

Neighbour: [doesn't laugh]

Ross: Hi, I'm Ross, I'm new to the building.

Neighbour: Yes, you were the one who didn't chip in for the handyman.

Ross: Never mind.

Neighbour: Actually, I thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. You had just moved in.

Ross: I had just moved in! Thank you!

"
386,NA,NA,"Joey: What are you worried about? The Vicar will be here any minute.

"
387,NA,NA,"Emily's Father: I could kill you with my thumb, you know...

"
388,NA,NA,"Emily's Father: [to his wife] Come on, buggerface!

Andrea Waltham: [smacks Ross on her way out] Call me!

"
389,NA,NA,"Phoebe: You know, we thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.

"
390,NA,NA,"Phoebe: You know, this reminds me of the time I was living on the street and this guy said he'd buy me food if I slept with him. Because that was a real problem and this is just some High School crap.

"
391,NA,NA,"Ross: [she's lost his monkey] This is just classic Rachel! You're off in Rachel land with no thought for people's feelings or monkeys!

"
392,NA,NA,"Jack Geller: Now, are you his Mother or his Father? What? I've never seen one before! I never even got a chance to pretend I'm okay with it...

"
393,NA,NA,"Joey: You bet on the bet and if you lose you lose the bet!

"
394,NA,NA,"Phoebe: There's no such thing as an innocent Burger.

"
395,NA,NA,"Chandler: [Name the 50 States Game] If you can't do it you can't do it. That's the great thing about this game, it makes you want to kill yourself.

"
396,NA,NA,"Barbershop Quartet Singer: No-one likes a Buttmunch!

"
397,NA,NA,"Chandler: At least your middle name isn't Murial!

Ross: Chandler M Bing? Your parents never gave you a chance, did they?

"
398,NA,NA,"Chandler: [can't talk Phoebe's boyfriend out of moving in with her] Were your parents HAPPY or something?

"
399,NA,NA,"Phoebe: We're... just saying Goodbye to the Hotel. We LOVE you, Paradise Hotel, Golf Resort and Spa!

"
400,NA,NA,"Monica: I use my breasts to get people's attention!

Rachel: We both do that!

"
401,NA,NA,"Ross: NO FALAFEL FOR YOU!

"
402,NA,NA,"Phoebe: Are you kidding, that woman has the nose of a bloodhound! And the breasts of a Greek Goddess...

"
403,NA,NA,"Phoebe: [singing in the Hospital] At first they're so cute and soft to the touch/ Then they grow up and resent you so much/ Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why/ and you cry and you cry and you cry/ and you cry and you cry and you cry and you cry... Thanks Ross!

Ross: I'm paying you to STOP!

"
404,NA,NA,"Joey: You're a pain in my ass, Geller!

"
405,NA,NA,"Ross: Cat!

"
406,NA,NA,"Ross: I went through the same thing with Carol and you know what I did? I got dressed really quickly.

"
407,NA,NA,"Susie: You know why I like you?

Chandler: Because my parents sent me to an all-boys Boarding School and now God is making up for it?

"
408,NA,NA,"Joey: Ross, if Homo Sapiens were HOMO Sapiens, is that why they're extinct?

Ross: Joey, ""Homo Sapiens"" are People.

Joey: Hey, I'm not Judging!

"
409,NA,NA,"Chandler: When I get back it's going to be Chair City, and I'll be the one who's sitting on chairs!

"
410,NA,NA,"Chandler: Full bag... warm bowl... something horrible must have happened here!

"
411,NA,NA,"Chandler: Big head, big head, big head!

"
412,NA,NA,"Chandler: You know, you're a great guy, Richard.

Richard: Yeah. I hate that.

"
413,NA,NA,"Joey: Don't interrupt me when I'm talking to God!

"
414,NA,NA,"Joey: Want some jam?

Chandler: No thanks, I just had a jar of mustard.

"
415,NA,NA,"[When one of Ross' male students claims to be in love with him]

Ross: I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it? Am I giving out some kind of... sexy professor vibe?

Rachel: Not right now.

"
416,NA,NA,"Mona: Thanks for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. You got 300 of them. It was fascinating. So, we still on for tonight?

Ross: Sure.

Mona: Ok. Bye.

Ross: Bye.

"
417,NA,NA,"Ross: Did you see the kid on that nose?

"
418,NA,NA,"Ross: You're crazy!

Benjamin Hobart: Crazy? Or... Romantic?

Ross: Crazy!

Benjamin Hobart: Ooor...

Ross: Get out!

"
419,NA,NA,"Ross: Wow, you sure have a lot of books on being a Lesbian.

Susan: Well, you have to take a Course. Otherwise they don't let you do it.

"
420,NA,NA,"Dr. Leonard Green: So, Geller, is this what you dumped my Rachel for,

[points at Mona]

Dr. Leonard Green: so you could hang around with this tramp!

Mona: *Tramp*?

Ross: Oh, uh; Dr. Green, Mona; Mona, Dr. Green.

"
421,NA,NA,"Ross: The door's closed! I can't see anything with the door closed!

Chandler: And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.

"
422,NA,NA,"Gunther: Here is your coffee.

Ross: Thanks Gunther, or ""dank je wel voor de koffie"".

Gunther: You are speaking Dutch - ""heb je familie daar?""

Ross: Yeah we are done.

Gunther: Ezel.

"
423,NA,NA,"Chandler: Did you do it on our invitations?

Ross: Not on the ones we sent out.

Chandler: Oh, so it was on the ones, we had framed.

"
424,NA,NA,"Ross: So I don't know if he's testing me or just acting out but my monkey is OUT OF CONTROL!... He keeps erasing the messages on my machine!

Rachel: Oh yeah... I've done that

Ross: And a few days ago he got to the newspaper before I did and peed all over the crossword!

Rachel: I've never done that

Ross: And last night I don't know what he did but there were capers EVERYWHERE!

"
425,NA,NA,"Ross: I made Marcel's favorite: Banana cake...

Joey: Mmm.

Ross: ...with mealworm.

Joey: Ugh.

"

[sees Rachel]

Ross: ... Someone who...

Chandler: Little play things with yarn?

Ross: What?

Chandler: Could you want her more?

Ross: Who?

Chandler: Dee the sarcastic sister from ""What's Happening"".

"
427,NA,NA,"Chandler: You kissed my best Ross!

"
428,NA,NA,"Chandler: So, is he house trained or is he going to leave little bathroom tiles all over the place?

"
429,NA,NA,"Dr. Long: [It's triplets] Doctors are wrong all the time.

"
430,NA,NA,"Chandler: Do you have the revised Annual Network Usage Summary?

Colleague: We haven't seen an ANUS this bad since the 70s.

"
431,NA,NA,"Phoebe: PICK UP THE SOCK! PICK UP THE SOCK! PICK UP THE SOCK!

"
432,NA,NA,"Chandler: [Everyone's hugging] Aw... oh that's right, I have no-one.

"
433,NA,NA,"Ross: [Long, serious lecture] All of which proves that I thought of Jurassic Park first.

"
434,NA,NA,"Gunther: I broke a cup.

"
435,NA,NA,"Joey: [living alone] I thought I'd spend more time with my thoughts, but it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.

"
436,NA,NA,"Phoebe: Stop, you guys! Look what you're doing to Chandler!

"
437,NA,NA,"Monica: So if your parents had stayed together you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?

"
438,NA,NA,"Rachel: Ever since I was humiliated, I've not been in a very museum-benefitty sort of place.

"
439,NA,NA,"Chandler: Go with the Egg, my friend!

"
440,NA,NA,"Bully: [to Chandler] You know what I don't like about you? You've always got something to say.

"

"
442,NA,NA,"Joey: I just dropped by to say you're not a real Doctor! And that woman's brain... is fine.

"
443,NA,NA,"Colleague: Now, Chandler, I'm going to need this back on Tuesday.

Chandler: If you say so, Sir.

"
444,NA,NA,"Joey: Chandler is a mysterious fellow, one unlikely to take a wife.

"
445,NA,NA,"Phoebe: Leave me behind! I'm just a machine!

"
446,NA,NA,"Chandler: We just think Emily might be being a bit... unreasonable.

Joey: [pointing] Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!

"
447,NA,NA,"Phoebe: [making fun of TV] If I don't hold my hair, my head will fall off.

"
448,NA,NA,"Chandler: [making fun of TV] Oh she should not be wearing those pants! I say push her down the stairs!

"
449,NA,NA,"Monica: [trying to persuade Phoebe to live with Rachel] Did you know she has like a hundred pairs of shoes, and she'll let you borrow them?

Rachel: Yeah, and then you stretch them out with your big ol' clown feet...

Monica: You want to sleep outside, 'cos it's getting cold!

"
450,NA,NA,"Emily's Father: Do you want a piece of me, is that it? Do you want a piece of me?

"
451,NA,NA,"Joey: I want to be Mr. Hugglemunch!

"
454,NA,NA,"Joshua Burgin: Oh God, that Special Bond again!

Rachel: Well...

Joshua Burgin: Do you have a brother?

Rachel: No, but one of my sisters had a very... masculine energy.

Joshua Burgin: And how did you get on?

Rachel: Oh, I don't talk to them, they're not very nice people.

"
455,NA,NA,"Rachel: Does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?

Phoebe: I don't know, you might be the first one.

"
456,NA,NA,"Joey Tribbiani: Opposite is opposite!

"
457,NA,NA,"Monica: You are just going to have to stop pissing me off.

"
458,NA,NA,"Judy Geller: Oh, God. There's a toe in my kitchen...

"
459,NA,NA,"Joey Tribbiani: [whispers] Not knowing when to shut up!

Ross: Yep, that's my thing...

"
460,NA,NA,"Joey's Hand: Hi Daddy! Why don't you live with Mommy? Who's that other Lady? What's a Lesbian?

"
461,NA,NA,"Ross: Ugly Baby Judges you!

"
462,NA,NA,"Phoebe: [Chandler's run off] Come on, Ross we've got to think like Chandler!

Ross: So where's the one place he'd never expect us to look?

[Scene Cuts]

Ross: So THIS is your Office?

"
463,NA,NA,"Joey: There's always room for jello.

[Joey gets out his digital camera so he can take Chandler's picture in front of the Abbey]

Joey: Hey! Ok. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?

Chandler: Yeah, I think it's great. It's great. You know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.

Joey: Really? To what?

Chandler: To put the camera away!

Joey: Man, you are Westminster Crabby.

"
468,NA,NA,"Joey: The guy is like a cartoon!

"
469,NA,NA,"Joey: Do you want to hear something weird?

Phoebe: Always!

"
470,NA,NA,"Phoebe: I just gave birth to three children and I will not see them grow up in a World where Joey is right!

"
471,NA,NA,"Chandler: Hell is full of people like you.

"
472,NA,NA,"Ross: There was nothing in your father's fridge except Heavy Cream and Bacon. I think I solved the mystery of the heart attack.

"
473,NA,NA,"Monica: That was close.

Chandler: Yes, you almost over-reacted to something.

"
474,NA,NA,"Frank Buffay Jr.: No, it was perfect. Telling you about my likes and dislikes. How I like to melt things and dislike things that don't melt. A hooker tried to break my arm.

Phoebe: She's not a hooker.

Frank Buffay Jr.: Yes, but when I tell my friends about it later, she WILL BE a hooker.

"
475,NA,NA,"Chandler: He said ""Hey Todd, want a donut?"" And I wanted a donut. So now it's five years later, the donut's gone, and I'm still Todd.

"

"
477,NA,NA,"Richard: My parents are dead.

Monica: You're so lucky!

"
478,NA,NA,"Richard: I like them better than my other friends, all they say is: ""Do you know who just died shovelling snow?""

"
479,NA,NA,"Monica: It turns out Fun Bobby was Fun for a Reason!

"
480,NA,NA,"Phoebe: I'm not going to let that man make you eat your Baby.

"
481,NA,NA,"Joey: It must have been a great play, because I didn't understand a single word of it!

"
482,NA,NA,"Ross: I KNEW YOU'D BE MY DEATH, PHOEBE BUFFAY!

"
483,NA,NA,"Monica: [as the movers are moving a dresser out of the bedroom] Careful with that, it was my Grandmother's. Be careful.

[Two more movers are moving the giant white dog statue from the balcony]

Monica: If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.

[She hands the one mover some money]

Ross: [Looking around the now empty apartment] Wow.

Rachel: I know. Seems smaller, somehow.

Joey: Has it always been purple?

Chandler: [to the babies] Look around, you guys. This was your first home... and it was a happy place filled with love and laughter. But, more importantly, 'cause of rent control, it was a friggin' steal.

Phoebe: Hey, do you realize that at one time or another, we all lived in this apartment?

Monica: Oh yeah, that's true.

Ross: Uh, I haven't.

Monica: No, what about the Summer during college that you lived with Grandma? And you tried to make it as a dancer.

Ross: [as everyone awkwardly stares at him] Do you realize we almost made it 10 years without that coming up?

Monica: [to Chandler] Oh, Honey, I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.

Chandler: Oh, okay.

[as Monica and Chandler take their keys out of their pockets and place them on the kitchen counter, Ross, Rachel, Phoebe, and Joey, also, take out their keys to Monica's apartment and place them on the kitchen counter]

Phoebe: I guess this is it.

Joey: Yeah... I guess so.

Monica: [Crying] This is harder than I thought it would be.

[Chandler kisses Monica on her head, then hugs her, as Ross does the same to Rachel, whom is also crying, with Ross also hugging Monica, while still hugging Rachel, with Phoebe crying as well]

Rachel: What, do you guys have to move to the new house right away or do you have some time?

Monica: [Monica and Chandler look at each other, with Chandler nodding in agreement] We got some time.

Rachel: Okay, should we get some coffee?

Chandler: Sure.

[They begin walking towards the front door to exit the apartment]

Chandler: Where?
